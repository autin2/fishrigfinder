    <h1>About Fish Rig Finder</h1>
    <p>
      Fish Rig Finder was built to help anglers—new and experienced—figure out the best rigs for their current gear, bait, and fishing conditions. We know that not every trip to the water is the same, and choosing the right setup can mean the difference between a great day and going home empty-handed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you’re casting for bass, jigging for crappie, or just out for panfish with the kids, our tool asks a few simple questions and gives you suggestions that actually make sense. No fluff, no ads in the way—just straight-to-the-point fishing advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fish Rig Finder is made by people who actually fish. We’ve been on the banks, in the boats, and freezing on the ice. This site was made out of frustration with overly generic guides that never took YOUR gear into account.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have suggestions, feature requests, or just want to say thanks, don’t hesitate to reach out. Tight lines!
