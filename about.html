  <h1>About Fish Rig Finder</h1>
  <p>
    Fish Rig Finder is your go-to AI fishing assistant, providing custom fishing rig and bait suggestions based on your current tackle, water conditions, and target species. Whether you're freshwater fishing for bass, crappie, or panfish—or out on saltwater targeting redfish, snook, or striped bass—our intelligent tool helps you rig up the right way, every time.
  </p>

  <h2>Smart Fishing Rig Recommendations Based on Real Variables</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike generic fishing guides, Fish Rig Finder asks about the gear you actually use—rod type, reel strength, line, bait, hook size, and water conditions—and delivers precise, expert-backed rig suggestions. It's like having a professional fishing guide on your phone or computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our AI uses advanced logic to recommend optimal tackle combinations for surfcasting, lake fishing, river fishing, pier fishing, kayak fishing, and more. Whether you're bottom fishing, float fishing, or casting lures, Fish Rig Finder optimizes your setup.
  </p>
